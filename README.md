# Flashcard-o-Matic
Utilize React and Bootstrap to create a flash card web application where a user can create, edit, and delete a deck. Cards may be added, removed, or edited. 
There is a study function for each deck with a 3 card minimum requirement to function, otherwise the user is given the option to add cards.
